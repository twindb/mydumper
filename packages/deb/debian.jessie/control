Description: What is mydumper? Why?
 Parallelism (hence, speed) and performance (avoids expensive character
 set conversion routines, efficient code overall).
 .
 Easier to manage output (separate files for tables, dump metadata, etc,
 easy to view/parse data).
 .
 Consistency - maintains snapshot across all threads, provides
 accurate master and slave log positions, etc.
 .
 Manageability - supports PCRE for specifying database and tables
 inclusions and exclusions.
